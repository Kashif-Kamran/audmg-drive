## Introduction

Welcome to the **Serverless Media Storage and Retrieval System** project! This project is a hands-on exploration of AWS cloud services and serverless architecture, primarily focusing on AWS Lambda functions. The application functions as a simple media storage service where users can authenticate, upload, view, and download audio and image files securely.

The primary goal of this project is to gain practical experience with various AWS services and understand how they interact within a serverless framework. This README provides detailed information about the project's structure, setup, usage, and the learning outcomes achieved through its development.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login system to manage access to media files.
- **Media Upload**: Authenticated users can upload image and audio files to the system.
- **Media Retrieval**: Users can view and download their uploaded media files.
- **Access Control**: Custom authorization to ensure users can only access their own files.
- **Scalable and Serverless**: Leveraging AWS services to provide a highly scalable and cost-effective solution.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring using AWS CloudWatch.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Utilizing AWS SQS and SNS for reliable and asynchronous message processing.

## Architecture

The application follows a serverless architecture using AWS services orchestrated by the Serverless Framework. Below is an overview of the system's components and their interactions:

1. **API Gateway**: Acts as the entry point for all client requests, routing them to appropriate Lambda functions.
2. **Lambda Functions**:
    - **Authentication Functions**: Handle user signup and login processes.
    - **AuthValidator Function**: Serves as a custom authorizer middleware to validate and authorize user requests.
    - **Upload Function**: Processes and stores uploaded media files to AWS S3.
    - **Retrieve Function**: Fetches and returns media files from AWS S3 for authenticated users.
3. **AWS S3 Bucket**: Stores media files securely and efficiently.
4. **AWS SQS (Simple Queue Service)**: Manages message queuing for processing tasks asynchronously.
5. **AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service)**: Sends notifications and alerts related to media processing and system events.
6. **AWS CloudWatch**: Monitors application logs and performance metrics, aiding in debugging and system optimization.

    `aws configure`
    
    Provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region, and output format when prompted.

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up and deploy the project:

### 1. Clone the Repository

bash

Copy code

`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/serverless-media-storage.git cd serverless-media-storage`

### 2. Install Dependencies

bash

Copy code

`npm install`

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it with necessary environment variables:

dotenv

Copy code

`AWS_REGION=your-aws-region S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-s3-bucket-name JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret`

### 4. Deploy the Application

Use the Serverless Framework to deploy the application to AWS:

bash

Copy code

`serverless deploy`

This command will package and deploy all Lambda functions, create necessary AWS resources, and output the endpoints and resource identifiers.

### 5. Verify Deployment

After deployment, you will see output similar to:

bash

Copy code

`Service Information service: serverless-media-storage stage: dev region: us-east-1 stack: serverless-media-storage-dev api keys:   None endpoints:   POST - https://xxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/signup   POST - https://xxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/login   POST - https://xxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/upload   GET  - https://xxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/retrieve functions:   signup: serverless-media-storage-dev-signup   login: serverless-media-storage-dev-login   upload: serverless-media-storage-dev-upload   retrieve: serverless-media-storage-dev-retrieve`

**Accessing Logs**:

You can access the logs through the AWS Console:

1. Navigate to the **CloudWatch** service.
2. Select **Logs** from the sidebar.
3. Choose the log group corresponding to your Lambda function.
4. View and analyze the log streams as needed.
